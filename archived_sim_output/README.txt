# This folder contains the raw simulation output
# for 10 of the 100 simulations run for each
# zero sum / region of origin combination
# used in Hurlbert & Stegen 2014, Ecology Letters


# The simulations reported on in the paper correspond to the following sim.id's:

# Zero sum energy gradient, temperate origin: c(4075:4084, 4275:4364) [4075:4084 provided]
# Zero sum energy gradient, tropical origin: c(4065:4074, 4185:4274)  [4065:4074 provided]
# No zero sum constraint, temperate origin: c(3565:3664)              [3565:3574 provided]
# No zero sum constraint, tropical origin: c(3465:3564) 	      [3465:3474 provided]

# Full simulation output used in our paper can be found in the Dryad Data Repository
# associated with our paper.


# Note: Each zipped file pertains to a single simulation run
# and includes the following files:
#   all.pops: raw data of species distributions, time of origin and extinction, and traits over the entire simulation
#   time.rich: summary of the number of species per region in each time step of the simulation
#   phylo: a phylogeny of all species (extinct and extant) generated by the simulation
#   params.out: the parameters associated with that particular simulation run
